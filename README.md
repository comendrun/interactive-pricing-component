## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React Router Dom V.6
- Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

I really enjoyed working with tailwindCSS again.
It definitely made my coding faster but I very much prefer vanilla CSS. but sometimes it's great that I don't have to leave a .css file to change the style.
I also designed a second-page using react-router that will show up when you submit the offer. it already took so much time so I didn't have time to redesign the second page. But I should definitely do it soon.

### Continued development

I also designed a second-page using react-router that will show up when you submit the offer. it already took so much time so I didn't have time to redesign the second page. But I should definitely do it soon.
